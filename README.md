# Understanding vim

Movements in vim are nouns, example

h - left
j - down
k - up
l - right

Actions are nouns, example

d - delete
y - yank!

# Configuration
vim is all about customisations, my advice would be keep it lightweight when 
you start and then exapnd over it, stock vim without any plugins should allow 
you do most of the stuff anyway.

You can configure your vim using the vimrc file

# Plugins:
vim has a ton of plugins

If you can't find a particular plugin, make one
